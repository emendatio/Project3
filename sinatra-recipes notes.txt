Since the application just maps the flat files,
	you can browse either the source or the web app to view recipes.

If you check out the source you will see a few folders listed,
	in each folder there is a README.md that will briefly explain the topic.
	This can also be view by going to /p/:topic
		where topic is the folder you wish to view.

In each folder there should be a number of recipes pertaining to each topic.


Footer, etc., hard-coded into “./app.rb”
